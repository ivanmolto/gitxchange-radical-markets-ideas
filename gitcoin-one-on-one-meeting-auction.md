#Â GITCOIN MEET THE FUTURE AUCTION

Current Gitcoin grants match contributions with Quadratic Funding sponsored by donors in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The idea exposed here is to complement this philanthropic funding, raising a remarkable amount of funds through an auction-based system.

Gitcoin donors are key players in a blockchain and post-COVID era.
My idea is to enable someone bidding on Gitcoin to pay to have a one-on-one (virtual) meeting/lunch with one of these donors. 
This would be a good deal and wise use of money as the auction collection is going to feed tens of hundreds of open-source projects: 
- Gitcoin grants,
- Bounties, and an 
- Ethical advertising fund to promote and voice to the world the open-source projects arising from the Gitcoin community and ecosystem.

A second-price sealed-bid auction (a Vickrey auction) make sense for it. 
Each auction will begin with the auctioneer setting the reserve price.
Just a week before the Grants round, bidders submit sealed bid commitments and later reveal them. Highest revealed bid wins but the price to pay is only the price of the second-highest revealed bid.
While the English auction (discussed previously at the Gitcoin Mini CLR auction) and the Vickrey auction lead to an efficient market, and the results are similar as the choice between first and second price remains, in my opinion, the Vickrey auction adds a FOMO feeling to the bidders.

The winning bidder will get to meet (virtually) with the Gitcoin donor.
