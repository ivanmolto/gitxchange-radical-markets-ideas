#Â GITCOIN TOWNSQUARE VOICE TOKENS

TownSquare in Gitcoin is like the agora in ancient Greece.

It is an amazing space for members to share their insights, promote their grants, engage with announcements and contributions, get a share of the mini CLR distribution with mind-blowing strategies, and much more.

Tipping has been a revolution for the community as a test case to understand the matching pool in grants, data as labour, and last but not least the appreciation from other community members.

We have currently ether tipping but why not add an extra layer of rewards.
Why not getting voice tokens from our Contributor or Funder Rank from a distribution pool of voice tokens weekly. 
Any suggestion of other way of getting voice tokens is really welcome and appreciated!

Voice tokens should be used for QV on issues that the Gitcoin staff considers necessary to get feedback from the community. 

With the expansion of Gitcoin and the increase of members, it's clear that a way to give voice and get feedback will be valuable from all the players in the community.
