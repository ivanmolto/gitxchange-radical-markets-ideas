# GITCOIN REMOTE VIP PROGRAM

Gitcoin acting as a verticalized job marketplace focused on blockchain industry an enabling a remote VIP program to sponsor worldwide talent from companies which have participated in Gitcoin hackathons and bounties can be a win-win-win approach to talent placement.

Gitcoin could be more efficient than horizontal platforms such as Indeed, LinkedIn and others as Gitcoin would focus in only one industry, with a liquidity of talents with a portfolio built via bounties and hackathons, and blockchain companies participating in its ecosystem. A talent that can be delivered fast in a post-COVID world.

Companies sponsoring talent should pay a tax quantified in a number of future bounties that would help to nurture the talent pool with new candidates. And talent should also pay a tax quantified as a number of hours pro bono for the Gitcoin community.
